# SelectionTable
This is an attempt to create a pure HTML/CSS/Javascript table that has row selection capability. Moreover the table header is static so it would not scroll with the contents. Once the user makes a selection table expands to show the selected rows. User can then either delete a selection from selected rows in expanded view or by unchecking a table row. In order to support table with a lot of rows, a row filter on row contents is provided as well.
